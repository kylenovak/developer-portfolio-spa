# Developer Portfolio SPA
I built a SPA (Single Page Application) with a modern tech stack using JavaScript, ReactJS, ExpressJS, NodeJS, CSS, HTML, and more.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to highlight my skills and experience as a developer; it is my developer portfolio site reinvented (i had a developer portfolio already, I just rebuilt it with a modern tech stack and redesigned it too).

## Live
My project is being hosted on Heroku and can be viewed at https://www.kylejnovak.com.

## Achievements
What I achieved from this project was that I got to learn a lot of tools that I hadn't used before (i.e. ReactJS), as well as launch a full featured SPA app onto the web!

## Features
Project features include:
- Parallax scrolling
- CSS Transitions and Animations
- Google Maps API to display my location
- Gmail API to send email via a contact form
