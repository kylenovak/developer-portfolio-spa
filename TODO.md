TODO:
1.) sticky header - nav menu sticky when scrolled past initial nav
2.) highlight nav links on sticky nav when scrolling past the #headers (and on non-sticky nav)
3.) sticky header MENU toggle for mobile
4.) add some FADE-UP effects to the content in each section; i.e. as the user scrolls to that section, fade up the content. do this to all content starting at SKILLS section (or start right after the 3 bubble skill cards).
5.) Projects/Exp = image slider
6.) fix scrollTo on mobile (it's not accurate)
