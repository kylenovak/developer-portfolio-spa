KJN TODO:

NOTE!
FIX THESE FIRST:
a.) connect button - dont make it a LinkScroll, make it do a custom scroll event to Contact section.
b.) start button (down arrow scroll) - dont make it a LinkScroll, make it do a click event handle to a dom element (i.e. nav); this shouldnt be a URL link -- it should scroll to right above the blue nav bar (at which point, 1px scroll down more and the header becomes STICKY).

1. Skills section
   1.a Languages sub section (make horizontal/stacked bar chart)
   1.b Frameworks/libraries sub section (make pie chart, use D3?)
2. Experience section
   2.a Professional Experience sub section (make slider to slide over each job with added logo/info/key-bullet-points about the experience)
   2.b Education sub section (add MSU logo)
3. Projects section (make a slider to slide through the projects)
4. Contact section (add google map location STL as background with some contact info [email/social links])
5. nav menu sticky when scrolled past initial nav
6. top left MENU toggle
7. favicon = take screeny of fontawesome smiley-face icon!
8. ScrollUP = bottom right scroll up arrow icon
9. Active nav links on sticky nav when scrolling past the #headers (and on non-sticky nav)
10. Twitter + Github API (stars for what i'm interested in) for the ABOUT section
11. Contact form in JS? Utilize Google not a robot API before sending
12. implement another parallax scrolling section (maybe parallax twitter cards?)
13. About section - add a react clock showing how long i've been coding
