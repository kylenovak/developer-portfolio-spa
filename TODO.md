TODO:
-sync navigation active links
0.) highlight nav links on sticky nav WHEN SCROLLING past the #headers (and on non-sticky nav)
1.) add some FADE-UP effects to the content in each section; i.e. as the user scrolls to that section, fade up the content. do this to all content starting at SKILLS section (or start right after the 3 bubble skill cards).
2.) Projects/Exp = image slider
3.) fix scrollTo on mobile (it's not accurate)
