STICKY HEADER:::::
https://css-tricks.com/scroll-fix-content/

BONUS:
1.) add some FADE-UP effects to the content in each section; i.e. as the user scrolls to that section, fade up the content. do this to all content starting at SKILLS section (or start right after the 3 bubble skill cards).
2.) add slide-up for google maps when user scrolls down to footer area.
3.) footer cols (three): logo/name bio, Browse/nav, socail (twitt, link, git)
4.) SLIDER for EXP & PROJECTS (future proofs it)
*** Projects = image slider
*** About = chat bubble
*** contact = goog map / contact form

FIX THIS:
1.) remove the hardcoded y > 800 in ArrowUp.js because the distance to the nav bar can change based on screen width (so make this generalized).


2. Experience section
   2.a Professional Experience sub section (make slider to slide over each job with added logo/info/key-bullet-points about the experience)
   2.b Education sub section (add MSU logo)
3. Projects section (make a slider to slide through the projects)
4. Contact section (add google map location STL as background with some contact info [email/social links])
5. nav menu sticky when scrolled past initial nav
6. top left MENU toggle
7. favicon = take screeny of fontawesome smiley-face icon!
8. ScrollUP = bottom right scroll up arrow icon
9. Active nav links on sticky nav when scrolling past the #headers (and on non-sticky nav)
10. Twitter + Github API (stars for what i'm interested in) for the ABOUT section
11. Contact form in JS? Utilize Google not a robot API before sending
12. implement another parallax scrolling section (maybe parallax twitter cards?)
13. About section - add a react clock showing how long i've been coding
