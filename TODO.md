TODO:
0.) css media queries
1.) sticky header - nav menu sticky when scrolled past initial nav
2.) highlight nav links on sticky nav when scrolling past the #headers (and on non-sticky nav)
3.) sticky header MENU toggle for mobile
4.) add some FADE-UP effects to the content in each section; i.e. as the user scrolls to that section, fade up the content. do this to all content starting at SKILLS section (or start right after the 3 bubble skill cards).
5.) Projects/Exp = image slider
6.) contact form - remaining characters above submit button
7.) reset contact form on submit success
8.) hide scroll-up arrow when y == bottom, then on scroll up, show scroll-up arrow again. (it is hiding footer text)

FIX THIS:
1.) remove the hardcoded y > 800 in ArrowUp.js because the distance to the nav bar can change based on screen width (so make this generalized).
